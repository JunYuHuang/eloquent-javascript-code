# Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following
triangle:

```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

```js
let abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// â†’ 3
```

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
