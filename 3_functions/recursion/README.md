# Recursion

Weâ€™ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a
number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether itâ€™s divisible by two. Hereâ€™s
another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

- Zero is even.
- One is odd.
- For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The
function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return
a Boolean.

Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a
way to fix this?

# Script Notes - modified template based on [simple-typescript-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter)

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
