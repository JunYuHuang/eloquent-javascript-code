# A list

Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of data structures.
A common data structure is the list (not to be confused with array). A
list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the
second, the second to the third, and so on.

```js
let list = {
  value: 1,
  rest: {
    value: 2,
    rest: {
      value: 3,
      rest: null,
    },
  },
};
```

The resulting objects form a chain, like this:

```
[ value: 1   ]
[ rest:  ----]--> [ value: 2   ]
                  [ rest:  ----]--> [ value: 3   ]
                                    [ rest: null ]
```

A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure. For
example, if I create two new values `{value: 0, rest: list}` and `{value: -1, rest: list}`
(with `list` referring to the binding defined earlier), they are both
independent lists, but they share the structure that makes up their last three
elements. The original list is also still a valid three-element list.

Write a function `arrayToList` that builds up a list structure like the one
shown when given `[1, 2, 3]` as argument. Also write a `listToArray` function
that produces an array from a list. Then add a helper function `prepend`, which
takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the
front of the input list, and nth , which takes a list and a number and returns
the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first
element) or undefined when there is no such element.

If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of `nth`.

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
