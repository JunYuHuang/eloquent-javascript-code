# Iterable Groups

Make the `Group` class from the previous exercise iterable. Refer to the section
about the iterator interface earlier in the chapter if you arenâ€™t clear on the
exact form of the interface anymore.

If you used an array to represent the groupâ€™s members, donâ€™t just return
the iterator created by calling the `Symbol.iterator` method on the array. That
would work, but it defeats the purpose of this exercise.

It is okay if your iterator behaves strangely when the group is modified
during iteration.

## Exercise Hints

It is probably worthwhile to define a new class `GroupIterator`. Iterator
instances should have a property that tracks the current position in the
group. Every time `next` is called, it checks whether it is done and, if not,
moves past the current value and returns it.

The `Group` class itself gets a method named by `Symbol.iterator` that, when
called, returns a new instance of the iterator class for that group.

# Script Notes - modified template based on [simple-typescript-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter)

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
