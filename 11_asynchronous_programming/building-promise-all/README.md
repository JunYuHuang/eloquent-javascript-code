# Building Promise.all

Given an array of promises, `Promise.all` returns a promise that waits for all
of the promises in the array to finish. It then succeeds, yielding an array of
result values. If a promise in the array fails, the promise returned by `all fails
too, with the failure reason from the failing promise.

Implement something like this yourself as a regular function called
`Promise_all`.

Remember that after a promise has succeeded or failed, it canâ€™t succeed
or fail again, and further calls to the functions that resolve it are ignored.
This can simplify the way you handle failure of your promise.

## Exercise Hints

The function passed to the `Promise` constructor will have to call `then` on each
of the promises in the given array. When one of them succeeds, two things
need to happen. The resulting value needs to be stored in the correct position of a result array, and we must check whether this was the last pending
promise and finish our own promise if it was.

The latter can be done with a counter that is initialized to the length of
the input array and from which we subtract 1 every time a promise succeeds.
When it reaches 0, we are done. Make sure you take into account the situation where the input array is empty (and thus no promise will ever `resolve`).

Handling failure requires some thought but turns out to be extremely
simple. Just pass the `reject` function of the wrapping promise to each of the
promises in the array as a `catch` handler or as a second argument to `then` so
that a failure in one of them triggers the rejection of the whole wrapper
promise.

# Script Notes - modified template based on [simple-typescript-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter)

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
