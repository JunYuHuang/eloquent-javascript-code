# Groups

The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure called
`Set`. Like an instance of `Map`, a set holds a collection of values. Unlike `Map`,
it does not associate other values with thoseâ€”it just tracks which values
are part of the set. A value can be part of a set only onceâ€”adding it again
doesnâ€™t have any effect.

Write a class called `Group` (since `Set` is already taken). Like `Set`, it has `add`,
`delete`, and `has` methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, `add` adds a
value to the group (but only if it isnâ€™t already a member), `delete` removes its
argument from the group (if it was a member), and `has` returns a Boolean
value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.

Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as `indexOf`, to determine whether two values are the same.

Give the class a static `from` method that takes an iterable object as argument and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating
over it.

## Exercise Hints

The easiest way to do this is to store an array of group members in an
instance property. The `includes` or `indexOf` methods can be used to check
whether a given value is in the array.

Your classâ€™s constructor can set the member collection to an empty
array. When `add` is called, it must check whether the given value is in the
array or add it, for example with `push`, otherwise.

Deleting an element from an array, in `delete`, is less straightforward, but
you can use `filter` to create a new array without the value. Donâ€™t forget to
overwrite the property holding the members with the newly filtered version
of the array.

The `from` method can use a `for / of` loop to get the values out of the iterable object and call `add` to put them into a newly created group.

# Script Notes - modified template based on [simple-typescript-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter)

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
