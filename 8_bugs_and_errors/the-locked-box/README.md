# The Locked Box

Consider the following (rather contrived) object:

```js
const box = {
  locked: true,
  unlock() {
    this.locked = false;
  },
  lock() {
    this.locked = true;
  },
  _content: [],
  get content() {
    if (this.locked) throw new Error("Locked!");
    return this._content;
  },
};
```

It is a box with a lock. There is an array in the box, but you can get at it
only when the box is unlocked. Directly accessing the private `_content` property is forbidden.

Write a function called `withBoxUnlocked` that takes a function value as
argument, unlocks the box, runs the function, and then ensures that the
box is locked again before returning, regardless of whether the argument
function returned normally or threw an exception.

```js
const box = {
  locked: true,
  unlock() {
    this.locked = false;
  },
  lock() {
    this.locked = true;
  },
  _content: [],
  get content() {
    if (this.locked) throw new Error("Locked!");
    return this._content;
  },
};
function withBoxUnlocked(body) {
  // Your code here.
}
withBoxUnlocked(function () {
  box.content.push("gold piece");
});
try {
  withBoxUnlocked(function () {
    throw new Error("Pirates on the horizon! Abort!");
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.log("Error raised:", e);
}
console.log(box.locked);
// â†’ true
```

For extra points, make sure that if you call `withBoxUnlocked` when the box
is already unlocked, the box stays unlocked.

## Exercise Hints

This exercise calls for a `finally` block. Your function should first unlock the
box and then call the argument function from inside a `try` body. The `finally`
block after it should lock the box again.

To make sure we donâ€™t lock the box when it wasnâ€™t already locked,
check its lock at the start of the function and unlock and lock it only when
it started out locked.

# Script Notes - modified template based on [simple-typescript-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter)

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
