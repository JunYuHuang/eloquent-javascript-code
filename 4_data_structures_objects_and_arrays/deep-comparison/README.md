# Deep comparison

The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes youâ€™d prefer to
compare the values of their actual properties.

Write a function `deepEqual` that takes two values and returns true only if they
are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the values
of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to `deepEqual`.

To find out whether values should be compared directly (use the === operator
for that) or have their properties compared, you can use the `typeof` operator.
If it produces `"object"` for both values, you should do a deep comparison.
But you have to take one silly exception into account: because of a historical
accident, `typeof null` also produces `"object"`.

The `Object.keys` function will be useful when you need to go over the properties of objects to compare them.

# Script Notes - modified template based on [simple-typescript-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter)

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
