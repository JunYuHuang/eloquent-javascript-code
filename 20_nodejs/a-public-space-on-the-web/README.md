# A Public Space on the Web

Since the file server serves up any kind of file and even includes the right `Content-Type` header, you can use it to serve a website. Since it allows everybody to delete and replace files, it would be an interesting kind of website: one that can be modified, improved, and vandalized by everybody who takes the time to create the right HTTP request.

Write a basic HTML page that includes a simple JavaScript file. Put the files in a directory served by the file server and open them in your browser.

Next, as an advanced exercise or even a weekend project, combine all
the knowledge you gained from this book to build a more user-friendly interface for modifying the websiteâ€”from _inside_ the website.

Use an HTML form to edit the content of the files that make up the
website, allowing the user to update them on the server by using HTTP
requests, as described in Chapter 18.

Start by making only a single file editable. Then make it so that the user can select which file to edit. Use the fact that our file server returns lists of files when reading a directory.

Donâ€™t work directly in the code exposed by the file server since if you make a mistake, you are likely to damage the files there. Instead, keep your work outside of the publicly accessible directory and copy it there when testing.

## Exercise Hints

You can create a `<textarea>` element to hold the content of the file that is being edited. A `GET` request, using `fetch`, can retrieve the current content of the file. You can use relative URLs like _index.html_, instead of _http://localhost:8000/index.html_, to refer to files on the same server as the running script.

Then, when the user clicks a button (you can use a `<form>` element and `"submit"` event), make a `PUT` request to the same URL, with the content of the `<textarea>` as request body, to save the file.

You can then add a `<select>` element that contains all the files in the serverâ€™s top directory by adding `<option>` elements containing the lines returned by a `GET` request to the URL `/`. When the user selects another file (a `"change"` event on the field), the script must fetch and display that file.
When saving a file, use the currently selected filename.

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
