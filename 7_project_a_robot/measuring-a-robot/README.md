# Measuring a Robot

It’s hard to objectively compare robots by just letting them solve a few scenarios. Maybe one robot just happened to get easier tasks or the kind of tasks that it is good at, whereas the other didn’t.

Write a function `compareRobots` that takes two robots (and their starting memory). It should generate 100 tasks and let each of the robots solve each of these tasks. When done, it should output the average number of steps each robot took per task.

For the sake of fairness, make sure you give each task to both robots, rather than generating different tasks per robot.

## Exercise Hints

You’ll have to write a variant of the `runRobot` function that, instead of logging
the events to the console, returns the number of steps the robot took to
complete the task.

Your measurement function can then, in a loop, generate new states
and count the steps each of the robots takes. When the function has generated enough measurements, it can use `console.log` to output the average for
each robot, which is the total number of steps taken divided by the number
of measurements.

# Script Notes - modified template based on [simple-typescript-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter)

## 🧰 Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
