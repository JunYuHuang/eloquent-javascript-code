# Search Tool

On Unix systems, there is a command line tool called `grep` that can be used to quickly search files for a regular expression.

Write a Node script that can be run from the command line and acts
somewhat like `grep`. It treats its first command line argument as a regular expression and treats any further arguments as files to search. It should output the names of any file whose content matches the regular expression.

When that works, extend it so that when one of the arguments is a directory, it searches through all files in that directory and its subdirectories.

Use asynchronous or synchronous file system functions as you see fit.
Setting things up so that multiple asynchronous actions are requested at the same time might speed things up a little, but not a huge amount, since most file systems can read only one thing at a time.

## Exercise Hints

Your first command line argument, the regular expression, can be found in `process.argv[2]`. The input files come after that. You can use the `RegExp` constructor to go from a string to a regular expression object.

Doing this synchronously, with `readFileSync`, is more straightforward, but if you use `node:fs/promises` to get promise-returning functions and write an
`async` function, the code looks similar.

To figure out whether something is a directory, you can again use `stat` (or `statSync`) and the stats objectâ€™s `isDirectory` method.

Exploring a directory is a branching process. You can do it either by
using a recursive function or by keeping an array of work (files that still need to be explored). To find the files in a directory, you can call `readdir` or `readdirSync`.
Note the strange capitalizationâ€”Nodeâ€™s file system function nam-
ing is loosely based on standard Unix functions, such as `readdir`, that are all lowercase, but then it adds `Sync` with a capital letter.

To go from a filename read with `readdir` to a full path name, you have to combine it with the name of the directory, either putting `sep` from `node:path` between them, or using the `join` function from that same package.

## How to run

```bash
npx ts-node src/search.ts {pattern} {fileOrDirectoryN}
```

# Script Notes - modified template based on [simple-typescript-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter)

## ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2022

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Local development with Nodemon

### Scripts

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.

#### `npm run test:dev`

Run the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.
